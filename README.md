This repository contains a project about main concepts of **normal distribution** and its visualizations and practical exercises in Jupyter notebook.
The practical exercises includes solution for exercises provided in practical folder.

#### Topics of the practical exercises:
- Information
- Randomness
- Bias
- Outliers
- Cleasing

## How to run Jupyter notebook

### Installation requirements:
- [Python](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers)

Run this command to make sure Miniconda is installed

```
conda --version
```

Install a few key packages. In the Anaconda Prompt, type
```
conda install jupyter
```
When prompted with ‘Proceed ([y]/n)?’ type y

Once the installation completes, in the Anaconda Prompt, type:
```
jupyter notebook
```
A Jupyter Notebook interface will appear in your default browser.

Open a new Anaconda Prompt and type the following commands (hit ‘Enter’ after each row):

```
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install numpy
```

In case if jupyter notebook doesn't run on Windows laptop, please check this [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41034866/running-jupyter-via-command-line-on-windows)
